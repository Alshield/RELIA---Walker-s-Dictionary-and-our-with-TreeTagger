The tagset we obtained with our mapping has only 19 tags, compared to the Brown Corpus tagset size of 86 tags. Therefore, our small number of tags probably impacts the result.
Training on a bigger training set could give a better result. Most of the tags not used are rare tags that don't often appear in the training set. For example, the tag sp (for second person) appears only five times.\\
Our test set has only 2332 words (with punctuations), it is surely not enough to have an accurate result. In our case, even the number of failures is too  much for such a small amount of test data.
