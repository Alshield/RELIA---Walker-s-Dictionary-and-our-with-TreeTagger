We mapped the Walker's Dictionary's grammatical categories with Brown Corpus tagset, 
the Brown Corpus's tags not used in the mapping were replaced by other tags of the Brown Corpus.
We applied this mapping on a part of the Brown Corpus.
We trained treetagger with that part of the Brown Corpus.
We tagged another part of the Brown Corpus with the obtained tagger and compared tags given by Brown Corpus and our tagger.
